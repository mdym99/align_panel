Align Panel
===========

To install, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/matbryan52/align_panel.git
```

As of this time one dependency (Aperture) is not public and therefore
the installation will fail without the correct access rights.

Optionally, install into a virtual environment created via
`python -m venv ./path/to/environment` (see
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html> for more information).

To run the app:

```bash
align_panel
```

within the environment into which the package was installed.
